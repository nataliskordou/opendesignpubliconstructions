Open design lightweight public constructions

Name of project: opendesign4publiconstructions
 

INTRODUCTION

We designed lightweight construction modules which the users can use them such as a place for exhibitions, video projection, a place for relax,   entertainment or education. 
 
PRODUCTION AND ASSEMBLANGE

The production and the assemblage will be take place in situ through the usage of specific machines CNC and manuals. At first, we will design the units and cut them with the help of CNC.  Afterwards the units dovetail with each other through gibs using a simple hammer as it will be illustrated in manuals.
The unit consists of 3 modulo joined by means of a special system, which is placed in the inner side. Each modulo consists of standardized parts of specific dimensions and a wooden carrier that dovetail with a wooden surface. Its dimensions are 3*1.25 m and its height reaches 2.70 m. Each unit contains the appropriate technological equipment and furniture, designed and assembled in the same way as above, in order to cover the needs of the exhibition. Each modulo has various spaces-positions, on which the equipment-furniture snaps. These positions are in various places so that they provide flexibility depending on the needs of the exhibition. 
The whole construction is placed upon metal foundations-"legs" which are convertible in length in order to adapt in various surfaces. The roof has a slight angle and also been reinforced with asphalt cloth so as not to allow water to enter the construction.  
The same path we follow for the assemblage of modulo 2.
 
MANUALS

Follow the instruction to assemble modulo 1 and modulo 2.
